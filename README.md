Cardiovascular diseases are a category of diseases wherein the heart malfunctions primarily due to blockages and clots in blood vessels. The causes of cardiovascular diseases widely range from lack of physical activity to unhealthy choices of food, which make them the number one cause of death globally. Thus, there arises a need to accurately predict the chance of survival for a person suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Machine learning and data analytics has proved to be quite useful in prediction tasks. Today, the amount of patient data accessible has increased considerably, which makes machine learning algorithms most suitable for understanding the relation between symptoms and cardiovascular diseases.
